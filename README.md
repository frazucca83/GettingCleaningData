This is the README file for the Programming Assignment of the course Getting and Cleaning the Data. 

The repository contains the following files. 

1. tidy_data.txt: contains the average, for each activity and each subject, of the mean and of the standard deviation of the different activity-related variables. 
2. CodeBook.md: Describes the dataset, and how to obtain it starting from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.
3. run_analysis.R: The script to obtain the dataset, tidy_data.cvs, from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. 
4. This README.md file.


IMPORTANT NOTES: 
=========================

1. These files MUST be complemented by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The  Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset to create the tidy_data.cvs has been downloaded on 2017-10-30. 

2. The path to the files contained in the local copy of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, MUST be adapted before running the script.
